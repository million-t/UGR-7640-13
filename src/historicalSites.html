    <p>The fortress city functioned as the centre of the
        Ethiopian government until 1864. It has some twenty
        palaces, royal buildings, highly decorated churches,
        monasteries and unique public and private buildings,
        transformed by the Baroque style brought to Gondar by
        the Jesuit missionaries.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>  
    <img src="images/gondar2.jpg" alt="here is an image of the side view of fasil gibi" width="250px">  
    <p>The origins of the Fasil Ghebbi can be found in the old tradition of Ethiopian emperors traveling around their
        possessions, living off the produce of the peasants and dwelling in tents. Reflecting this connection, this precinct
        was frequently referred to as a katama ("camp" or "fortified settlement") or makkababya , the name applied to the
        imperial camp in the Royal Chronicle of Baeda Maryam. Emperor Fasilides broke with this tradition of progressing
        through the territories, and founded the city of Gondar as his capital; its relative permanence makes the city
        historically important. Within the capital, he commanded the construction of an imposing edifice, the Fasil Gemb or
        Fasilides castle. The area around the Fasil Gemb was delineated by a wall with numerous gates. Subsequent
        emperors built their own structures, many of which survive either in whole or part today. Visiting the Fasil Ghebbi in
        the late 1950s, Thomas Pakenham observed that "dotted among the palaces are what remains of the pavilions and
        kiosks of the imperial city". The original buildings were influenced by Nubian , Arab, and Indian architectural design,
        with later Baroque Architectural styling introduced by Jesuit Missionaries. 
    </p>
    <p>A large number of the buildings at Fasil Ghebbi did not survive the events of the time, but the place is still rich in
        buildings that were renovated both by the Italian occupiers in the late 1930s and after Ethiopia regained its
        independence. The site was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979, which stated in its decision that it
        faithfully represents modern Ethiopian civilization at north of Lake Tana which appeared in the early 17th century and
        influenced Ethiopian architecture for many years. Fasil Ghebbi also includes the Fasilides Baths, a construction
        which is also attributed to Emperor Fasilides, and the Imperial Complex of Empress Mantawab in
        Kuskam, which is considered one of the most important tourist destinations in the country.

    <h2>The Monuments of Aksum</h2>

    <img src="images/aksum.jpg" alt="Here lies the image of the monuments of aksum" width="250px">
    <p>These most impressive monuments in Axum are the monolithic obelisks, royal tombs and the palace ruins 
        dating to the 6th and 7th centuries AD. Several stelae survive in the town of Aksum dating 
        between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>    
    <p>The oblisk is found along with many other stelae in the city of Axum in modern-day Ethiopia. 
        The stelae were probably carved and erected during the 4th century CE by subjects 
        of the Kingdom of Aksum, an ancient Ethiopian civilization. Erection of stelae in 
        Axum was a very old practice, probably borrowed from the Kushitic kingdom of Meroe. 
        Their function is supposed to be as "markers" for underground burial chambers. The largest of 
        the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-story false windows 
        and false doors, while lesser nobility would have smaller, less decorated ones. While there are 
        only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in various "stelae fields". 
        It is still possible to see primitive, roughly carved stelae near more elaborate "obelisks". 
        The last stele erected in Axum was probably the so-called King Ezana's Stele, in the 4th century CE.
