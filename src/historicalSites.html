    <p>The fortress city functioned as the centre of the
        Ethiopian government until 1864. It has some twenty
        palaces, royal buildings, highly decorated churches,
        monasteries and unique public and private buildings,
        transformed by the Baroque style brought to Gondar by
        the Jesuit missionaries.</p></div></div>

        <img class="float-start m-3 " src="images/gondar2.jpg" alt="here is an image of the side view of fasil gibi" width="250px">  
        <p>The origins of the Fasil Ghebbi can be found in the old tradition of Ethiopian emperors traveling around their
            possessions, living off the produce of the peasants and dwelling in tents. Reflecting this connection, this precinct
            was frequently referred to as a katama ("camp" or "fortified settlement") or makkababya , the name applied to the
            imperial camp in the Royal Chronicle of Baeda Maryam. Emperor Fasilides broke with this tradition of progressing
            through the territories, and founded the city of Gondar as his capital; its relative permanence makes the city
            historically important. Within the capital, he commanded the construction of an imposing edifice, the Fasil Gemb or
            Fasilides castle. The area around the Fasil Gemb was delineated by a wall with numerous gates. Subsequent
            emperors built their own structures, many of which survive either in whole or part today. Visiting the Fasil Ghebbi in
            the late 1950s, Thomas Pakenham observed that "dotted among the palaces are what remains of the pavilions and
            kiosks of the imperial city". The original buildings were influenced by Nubian , Arab, and Indian architectural design,
            with later Baroque Architectural styling introduced by Jesuit Missionaries. 
        <br/>A large number of the buildings at Fasil Ghebbi did not survive the events of the time, but the place is still rich in
            buildings that were renovated both by the Italian occupiers in the late 1930s and after Ethiopia regained its
            independence. The site was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979, which stated in its decision that it
            faithfully represents modern Ethiopian civilization at north of Lake Tana which appeared in the early 17th century and
            influenced Ethiopian architecture for many years. Fasil Ghebbi also includes the Fasilides Baths, a construction
            which is also attributed to Emperor Fasilides, and the Imperial Complex of Empress Mantawab in
            Kuskam, which is considered one of the most important tourist destinations in the country.

        <p>The oblisk is found along with many other stelae in the city of Axum in modern-day Ethiopia. 
            The stelae were probably carved and erected during the 4th century CE by subjects 
            of the Kingdom of Aksum, an ancient Ethiopian civilization. Erection of stelae in 
            Axum was a very old practice, probably borrowed from the Kushitic kingdom of Meroe. 
            Their function is supposed to be as "markers" for underground burial chambers. The largest of 
            the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-story false windows 
            and false doors, while lesser nobility would have smaller, less decorated ones. While there are 
            only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in various "stelae fields". 
            It is still possible to see primitive, roughly carved stelae near more elaborate "obelisks". 
            The last stele erected in Axum was probably the so-called King Ezana's Stele, in the 4th century CE.
