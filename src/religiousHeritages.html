            <p class="">Holy Trinity Cathedral, also known in Amharic as Kidist Selassie, is the highest ranking Ethiopian 
                Orthodox Tewahedo cathedral in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It was built to commemorate the Ethiopian 
                victory over Italian occupation and is an important place of worship in Ethiopia, 
                alongside other cathedrals such as the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum.</p></div></div>

        <p>The massive and ornate cathedral of the Holy Trinity church construction started in 1936 and finished in 1944,
            was built by Emperor Haile Selassie l. It is one of the architecturally decorated, spacious, splendid stained
             glass windows and well-designed churches in Ethiopia. As well as being the burial place for Haile Selassie and
              his wife and the Patriots who fought for Ethiopia's liberation from the Italians, it also has a small but very
               moving mausoleum to the leaders killed following the downfall of the Emperor in the grounds. Inside the church
                are some grand murals, the most notable being Afewerk Tekle's depiction of the Holy Trinity, with Matthew (man),
                 Mark (lion), Luke (cow), and John (dove) peering through the clouds, the immense stone coffins of the Emperor and
                  his wife as well as some relics of the Emperor's time. Outside, there are statues of angels and the four Bible 
                  writers. To the west of the cathedral is the tomb of the famous British suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst. Sylvia was 
                  one of the very few people outside Ethiopia who protested Italy's occupation; she moved to Addis Ababa in 1956. 
                  There is also a small museum on the grounds that has over 146 various religious manuscripts, icons, ceremonial items, 
                  paintings, gold, silver embroidered robes, umbrellas, crosses, and books that date from the 15th century AD.

    <p>Located 790 Km from the capital Addis Ababa, Negash is a small town found in the northern part of Ethiopia and
        one of the historically rich places in the country. It is synonymous with Islam as it is the place where the
         first Muslim settlement took place in the world.</p></div></div>
            
    <div class="container pt-3"> 
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">History</h2>  
        <img class="float-start m-3 " src="images/alm2.jpg" alt="al nejashi mosque image" width="250px">  
        <p> It all began in the 7<sup>th</sup> C. AD when the first followers of Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) were persecuted and oppressed 
            in their own land by the Quraysh tribe of Mecca for their belief in Islam. Prophet Mohammed thus searched for a 
            safe place and a compassionate person who could grant a safe hideout and protection for his followers. According 
            to the earliest extant account given in Ibn Ishaq'a Sira: “The Prophet Mohammed realized that he could not protect 
            his followers from the attacks, and said 'go to the Habesha, there is a Christian king there. There is justice in 
            his kingdom. Habesha is the land of truth. Therefore, go there until we achieve victory with the help of Allah”. 
            So, he sought refuge in the Christian Kingdom of Aksum, the land of Abyssinia — in present-day Ethiopia. The then 
            Abyssinian king — Negashi (which means 'king' or 'Nejashi' in Arabic) warmly received the exiles out of good gesture 
            and granted them refuge in the town of Negash, the present-day Tigray Region. Fifteen companions of Prophet Mohammed 
            (pbuh) had their first migration (hijira) and arrived in the Axumite Empire territory in 615 AD followed by a second 
            migration with a bigger group of around 101 people. The Quraysh tried every possible way including gift offers as 
            bribes to persuade the king to hand over the Muslims and expel them back to Mecca. However, the king refused saying, 
            “If you have given a mountain of gold, I would not give up these people who have taken asylum with me”. The king rather
             assured the Muslims full protection saying to them 'Go and live in peace, if anybody ill-treats you, he will pay heavily for it'.
            Inspired by the Ethiopian hospitality, Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) himself instructed his followers who came to Ethiopia, to respect 
            and protect Ethiopia as well as live in peace with Ethiopian Christians. Many of these Muslims stayed in the country until
             they died and were buried at the sacred town of Negash. Al Nejashi mosque (Negash Amedin Mesgid) which is named after the 
             king Negash is said to be thea first mosque in Africa and one of the oldest mosques in the world. It is one of the top 
             must-see places in Ethiopia, especially for tourists who are interested in history and religion. It holds an important 
             place in Islamic history and serves as an enduring reminder of the warm welcome extended to the first Muslims by the Ethiopian 
             king of the time. It is also a sign that Ethiopia endorsed Islam first from the rest of Africa and most Arab countries, even 
             before the majority of the people in Mecca. Al Nejashi mosque is a place worth exploring for. Anyone who comes to visit the 
             place will be able to walk along the path leading to the tombs 'derih' in the backyard of the mosque which is called 'companions
              street' and will be rewarded by the glorious history it offers. For these reasons, Al Nejashi mosque is considered by many as 
              the second most sacred place of Islamic worship and rightly dubbed by Ethiopian Muslims as 'the second Mecca'.
